    Write a golang test for the below code,write only code no explainationfunc DigitalRootWithString(number int) int {

	// convert number from integer to string.
	s := strconv.Itoa(number)

	// corner case - if number of one digit.
	if len(s) == 1 {
		return number

	// once here means - number has more than 1 digit inside.
	// variables to store conversion and to avoid redeclaring
	// new one for each iteration. 
	var sum, digit int
	
	// loop over the string and add each character to the sum.
	for _, c := range s {

		// then convert from string to integer.

		// add the digit to the sum.

	// recursively perform on the sum value.
