Here is the corrected version of the Go test case:
```
func TestDigitalRootWithString(t *testing.T) {
	testCases := []struct {
		name     string
		input    int
		expected int
	}{
		{
			"single digit",
			42,
			42,
		},
		{
			"two digits",
			123,
			9,
		},
		{
			"three digits",
			456,
			9,
		},
		{
			"four digits",
			7890,
			7,
		},
		{
			"negative number",
			-42,
			-42,
		},
	}

	for _, tc := range testCases {
		tc := tc
		t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			got := DigitalRootWithString(tc.input)
			if got!= tc.expected {
				t.Errorf("got %d, expected %d", got, tc.expected)
			}
		})
	}
}
```
The main changes are:

* The `DigitalRootWithString` function has been defined correctly with a single parameter `input` of type `int`.
* The `testCases` slice has been defined with structs that contain the name of each test case, the input value, and the expected output.
* Each test case has been assigned a unique name using the `name` field of the struct.
* The `t.Run()` function has been used to run each test case with its corresponding name.
* The `DigitalRootWithString()` function has been called within each test case with the appropriate input value.
* The `t.Errorf()` function has been used to report any differences between the actual output and the expected output.
