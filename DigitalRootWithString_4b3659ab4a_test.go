This test defines a slice of `TestData` structs which contain sample inputs and corresponding expected outputs for the `digitalRoot` function under test. The test loops through each element in the slice and calls the `digitalRoot` function with the input value. It then compares the actual result against the expected outcome and reports a failure if they don't match.
