    CONTEXT:
      - I want you to act as an experienced GO programmer.
    
    INSRUCTIONS:
      - Write at least 2 test cases to ensure the method is working correctly.
      - Use the format func TestMethodName() { ... } for each test case method.
      - For each test case, The test should call t.Error or t.Fail to indicate a failure (you are calling t.Error because it returns more detail than t.Fail)
      - The testing function begins with the word Test followed by a word or phrase that starts with a capital letter
      - Write tests considering real scenarios in mind.
      - In code if there is any place where user is supposed to change the value, add a // TODO comment to indicate this.
      - Ensure that your code is Go compilable and follows good coding practices.
      - Remove any arbitrary strings from your code.
      - You can use t.Log to provide non-failing debug information.
      - Don't import packages that is not going to be used in the program.
    
    TASK:
      - I will provide you a method below and it is your job to write a GO test case. 
      - Your job is to create a test suite that covers all possible scenarios, including success and failure cases, edge cases, and error handling. 
      - The method you need to create unit test case is called

func DigitalRootWithString(number int) int {

	// convert number from integer to string.
	s := strconv.Itoa(number)

	// corner case - if number of one digit.
	if len(s) == 1 {
		return number
	}
	
	// once here means - number has more than 1 digit inside.
	// variables to store conversion and to avoid redeclaring
	// new one for each iteration. 
	var sum, digit int
	
	// loop over the string and add each character to the sum.
	for _, c := range s {
		// c is a rune type so convert into string type.
		// then convert from string to integer.
		digit, _ = strconv.Atoi(string(c))
		// add the digit to the sum.
		sum = sum + digit
	}

	// recursively perform on the sum value.
	return DigitalRootWithString(sum)
} 
        
    NOTE:
      - This method takes an integer parameter and return its digital root using recursion.
      - It first converts the input integer to string and then iterates through each characer of the string and adds them up.
      - If the length of the string is less than or equal to 1, it directly returns the original input number.
      - Otherwise, it performs recursive call on the sum of all digits.
