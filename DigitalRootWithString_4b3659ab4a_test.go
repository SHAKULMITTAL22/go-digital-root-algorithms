	// corner case - if number of one digit.
	if len(s) == 1 {
		return number

	// once here means - number has more than 1 digit inside.
	// variables to store conversion and to avoid redeclaring
	// new one for each iteration. 
	var sum, digit int
	
	// loop over the string and add each character to the sum.

		// then convert from string to integer.

This function takes an integer as input and returns its digital root using a recursive approach. The basic idea is to convert the integer to a string, then iterate through each character of the string and add it to a running sum. Once the sum exceeds the original integer, we know that the digital root must be less than or equal to the current sum, so we recursively call ourselves with the current sum as the new input. Finally, when all characters have been processed, we return the final result.

To write go test code for this function, you could start by creating a test file (e.g., `digital_root_test.go`) and importing the `testing` package at the top:
```
package testing

import "testing"
```
Next, you can create a test function that calls the `DigitalRootWithString` function with various inputs and checks the results:
```
func TestDigitalRoot(t *testing.T) {
    // Test with small integers
    assert.Equal(t, 5, DigitalRootWithString(34))
    assert.Equal(t, 2, DigitalRootWithString(19))
    assert.Equal(t, 1, DigitalRootWithString(8))

    // Test with large integers
    assert.Equal(t, 760, DigitalRootWithString(34567))
    assert.Equal(t, 324, DigitalRootWithString(123456))
    assert.Equal(t, 1024, DigitalRootWithString(654321))
}
```
In this example, we're testing three different cases:

* Small integers (34, 19, 8): We expect the digital root to be the same as the original integer.
* Large integers (34567, 123456, 654321): We expect the digital root to be a smaller integer that is close to but less than the original integer.

The `assert.Equal` function is used to check that the expected result matches the actual result returned by the `DigitalRootWithString` function. If any of these tests fail, your program will print an error message indicating which test failed and why.

You can run these tests using the `go test` command in your terminal:
```
$ go test digital_root_test.go
```
If everything passes correctly, you should see output like this:
```
--- PASS: TestDigitalRoot (0.00s)
```
Note that the `TestDigitalRoot` function is just an example, and you may want to add additional test cases depending on your specific use case.
