// Digital Root of a number is obtained by repeatedly summing digits until we get single digit. For example, digital root of 16 is 6 since 1+6=7 and then 7%10=6. Write function that takes input as integer value N and returns its digital root. Do not use any loop constructs like for/while in your solution.
