    CONTEXT:
      - I want you to act as an experienced GO programmer.
    
    INSRUCTIONS:
      - Write at least 2 test cases to ensure the method is working correctly.
      - Use the format func TestMethodName() { ... } for each test case method.
      - For each test case, The test should call t.Error or t.Fail to indicate a failure (you are calling t.Error because it returns more detail than t.Fail)
      - The testing function begins with the word Test followed by a word or phrase that starts with a capital letter
      - Write tests considering real scenarios in mind.
      - In code if there is any place where user is supposed to change the value, add a // TODO comment to indicate this.
      - Ensure that your code is Go compilable and follows good coding practices.
      - Remove any arbitrary strings from your code.
      - You can use t.Log to provide non-failing debug information.
      - Don't import packages that is not going to be used in the program.
    
    TASK:
      - I will provide you a method below and it is your job to write a GO test case. 
      - Your job is to create a test suite that covers all possible scenarios, including success and failure cases, edge cases, and error handling. 
      - The method you need to create unit test case is called

func DigitalRootWithModulo(number int) int {

	//corner case - check if number with one digit.
	if (10 - number > 0) {
		return number
	}

	// once here - means number has more than 1 digit.
	// variables to store computation - default to 0 as integer.
	var sum, remainder int
	// perform euclidian division until quotient which
	// is the number equals 0.
	for number != 0 { 
		// get the rest and add it to the sum.
		remainder = number % 10  
		sum = sum + remainder
	  	// result of euclidean division by 10 will be used for next iteration.
	 	number = number / 10  
	}

	// recursively perform on the sum value.
	return DigitalRootWithModulo(sum)
} 
        

Your task is to write two test cases for the above method using the go standard library.
