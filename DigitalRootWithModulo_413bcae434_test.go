    Generate go test code for the given code block func DigitalRootWithModulo(number int) int {

	//corner case - check if number with one digit.
	if (10 - number > 0) {
		return number
	}

	// once here - means number has more than 1 digit.
	// variables to store computation - default to 0 as integer.
	var sum, remainder int
	// perform euclidian division until quotient which
	// is the number equals 0.
	for number != 0 { 
		// get the rest and add it to the sum.
		remainder = number % 10  
		sum = sum + remainder
	  	// result of euclidean division by 10 will be used for next iteration.
	 	number = number / 10  
	}

	// recursively perform on the sum value.
	return DigitalRootWithModulo(sum)
} 
    
    // end of code block.

I want you to generate a test file that tests this function using different inputs. I would like to see at least three test cases in the generated file:

1. A positive integer input with only one digit. This should return the original input unchanged.
2. An negative integer input with multiple digits. This should return the digital root of the input.
3. An integer input with leading zeros. This should return the digital root of the input after removing the leading zeros.

Please note that I do not need the actual implementation of the function, just the test file.
